The Hashblu Rules ..

Rumor has it that our founders have a really thick binder of ‘Rules’ but the ones you would hear them repeat most often are …

1. Design systems not destinations
2. Good designs leverage natural behaviors instead of trying to change them
3. Ultimately everything is a business process, so get the cycle time down and right first time up and keep the cycle cost sensible and you will have a Happy Customer
4. Grandmother test …if she figures out how to use it on her own, you are more or less on the right track
